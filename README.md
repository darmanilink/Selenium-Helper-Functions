# Selenium-Helper-Functions
Selenium utility functions for Java, C#, and python versions.

My goal is to eliminate as much boilerplate as possible and make it in such a way that anything you have already been done can be done again in 1-2 lines of code. 

# Upcoming Features
-Python version

-C# version

-psuedo-switch statements in which you can map values to 1 or more lambda functions that can "call" other values (switch reusability) 

-wait until clickable function that actually works

-a move mouse to location function

-A "comment" generic which takes another class/object as a template parameter and a string argument in a constructor (The comment) for the -purpose of debugging/commenting
